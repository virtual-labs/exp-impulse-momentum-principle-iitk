<b> Lab | <b> Fluid Mechanics Lab
<b> Experiment|     <b> Verification of impulse momentum principle

### About the Lab (objective):
The Fluid Mechanics Lab is designed to provide Chemical Engineering students with hands-on experience in understanding the behaviour of fluids under various conditions. The primary objective is to equip students with practical knowledge of fundamental fluid mechanics concepts and their applications in chemical and process industries. Through experimental work, students learn to analyse fluid flow, measure fluid properties, and evaluate performance characteristics of fluid handling equipment.

### About the Experiment 

This experiment involves verifying the impulse-momentum principle by analyzing the force exerted by a fluid jet on a flat or curved vane. It helps relate the change in momentum of the fluid to the impulse force generated. The study is essential for understanding fluid-structure interactions and is widely applied in hydraulic machines, turbines, and fluid jet systems.

### Target Audience :
Chemical Engineering/science students, faculty members & industry persons

### Course Alignment : 
This lab is aligned with core and applied courses such as Fluid Mechanics, Momentum Transfer, and Transport Phenomena. It reinforces theoretical concepts related to fluid flow behavior, pressure dynamics, and hydraulic equipment performance, supporting students' understanding of fluid systems in chemical process design, reactor engineering, and equipment selection.
